# Pomodoro Clock

This project was inspired by one of the freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Projects.

## Brief description

In the app I use React on the front. As for now the clock has a very limited functionality - it only lets you start, pause and stop 25 minutes timer. 

## Setup

You can run the project, by a command:

`run npm i && npm start`

and then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Live

Or you can just preview it under this link: (https://papi-pomodoro-clock.netlify.app/).
